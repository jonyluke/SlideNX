# SlideNX
A work in progress module to change JoyCon attach/detach sound

At the moment i was not able to mute default nintendo sound.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jonyluke/SlideNX/releases) and extract it to the root folder of your SD card.
Now you can use it with Hekate.

## How to use

(There are already mp3 files for testing)

Add the sound files you want to use to sounds folder

For changing the attach sound rename your mp3 to attach.mp3

For changing the disattach sound rename your mp3 to detach.mp3

If you want to use random sounds, change the content of the config.ini file from random=false to random=true and add all the mp3s in the sounds folder.
