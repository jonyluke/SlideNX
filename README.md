# SlideNX
A work in progress module to change JoyCon attach/detach sound

At the moment i was not able to mute default nintendo sound.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jonyluke/SlideNX/releases) and extract it to the root folder of your SD card.
Now you can launch it with Hekate.
If you want it also in ReiNX copy "slidenx.kip" from modules folder to /ReiNX/sysmodules

## How to use

(There are already mp3 files for testing)

Add the sound files you want to use to SlideNX folder

For changing the attach sound rename your mp3 to attach.mp3

For changing the disattach sound rename your mp3 to detach.mp3
